# customer-segmentation
The aim of this customer segmentation project is to categorize customers into different segments (A,B,C,D) based on features like Gender, Age, Profession and etc. By doing so, it will help group the customers based on their prefferences which would aid in coming up with marketing strategies got those segments.

This project uses sklearn to develop a machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier. Below is a brief explanation on the steps included in developing the model.
 
 
 ## Data Loading
 Uses Pandas to read the csv file in the dataset folder.
 
 ## EDA

## Data Cleaning

## Feature Selectiong
using PCA to perform feature selection to 2 components

## Data Preprocessing
using label encoder for to encode the feature and target values

## Model Development
Model used = Random Forest Classifier
